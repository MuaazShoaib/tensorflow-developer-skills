# Upwork Tensorflow Jobs

## Create an AI application developed in C++ using Tensorflow

Job link: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~019d35717440f2e2d8

We need build an application for face recognition using Tensorflow and C++. This application has to be listed on the NIST and as of today we have acquired the iBeta level 2 certificate.

You will be asked to answer the following questions when submitting a proposal:
   * Are you familiar with Biometrics?
   * Have you ever used Tensorflow? Tell me more
   * Describe your recent experience with similar projects
   * Please list any certifications related to this project

## NLP Text Comparison Model for Reinforcement Learning Pipeline
Job link: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~013f1f0b1cc555275f

We are in the middle of a long term project of a reinforcement learning pipeline for several large, pre-trained language models. The starting task of this pipeline involves the creation of a language model that can compare & rank between two or more text generation outputs from one of our existing models. This comparison engine will be the bedrock of our reinforcement learning pipeline, and used to train a natural language generator to output high quality content.

We would like an expert on causal language models to help us design and create this comparator. The project will have a soft deadline of two to four weeks, and you will be provided all of the GPU/data resources you need for the task. You will be expected to work full time during the period, and will receive payment when you are done producing a model capable of performing in an RL pipeline. Pay is negotiable depending on the candidate.

Since we are an NLP startup in the market for hiring another full-time ML engineer, we would also like to use this projects' highly unambiguous success criteria (low loss on the comparison dataset) as a tool to evaluate potential hires. We would love to offer at least one of the engineers we contract with a longer term position. If you are interested in gaining full-time employment as a researcher and engineer for extremely cutting edge deep learning and NLP work, this could be an excellent and objective way to showcase your skills.

Extra points will be given to candidates who are based in Bangalore, Karnataka and can meet physically with us. If you have any questions, feel free to message us for more details on the scope of the product and the kind of comparison engine you will be making.
