# TensorFlow Developer Skills

## Goal: Become a TensorFlow Expert

Start to Learn TensorFlow on 01-August-2021 (But I start to learn Machine Learning on 05-July-2021).

## How to become TensorFlow Expert?

### Status
* Currently I am taking the video lectures of NLP Fundamentals in TensorFlow.
* Video: 232. Visualising our model's learned word embeddings with TensorFlow's projector tool

### Learning Resources
* TensorFlow Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery
* TensorFlow Course Github Repo: https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning
* TensorFlow Book: https://dev.mrdbourke.com/tensorflow-deep-learning/
* Online Environment for Jupyter notebooks: https://colab.research.google.com/
